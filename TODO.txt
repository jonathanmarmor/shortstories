shortstories things to try:

- write rhythms at double or quadrupal tempo, eg 16th notes become 8th notes, or 16th notes become quarter notes, with the tempo adjusting accordingly

- use only ornaments with scalar motion

- much longer solo phrases (4x?)

- rather than two instruments in unison, two or more in parallel, similar, or contrary motion

- remove simple accompaniment parts

- actually write rhythm section textures
