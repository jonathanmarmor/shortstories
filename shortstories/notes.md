# What I know so far

piece
[sections?]
song (aaba aaba ccda aaba)
phrase (a, one bar long, 2/4, 4/4, 8/4)
harmonies (within a)
notes (within harmonies)


## guitar
sequence of chords
restricted by chord type or interval content
root motion by 5ths/4ths is weighted highly
all root motion intervals should happen
all chord type/interval/chord type varieties should happen
maybe have temporary restrictions on the harmonies (certain pitch classes dissallowed, certain pitch classes or chords emphasized, certain root motion intervals preferred or prohibited, different collection ot chord types)
just write the pitch classes as a block chord
ask the player to improvise voicings
ask the player to improvise arpeggiations
arpeggiations can be in time or out of time, they just need to fill the space between the notated chord and the next notated chord
arpeggiations can be ascending, descending, or broken, but mostly broken and with great variety of string order
maybe add a bass note as well, so the player knows which note should be lowest
one bar per phrase
bar lengths can be 2/4, 4/4, 8/4 (or maybe just start with all 4/4)
tempo should be quarter ~100 - 150, so eighths are fast, sixteenths are essentially grace notes
weight all beats according to their natural meter (first beat strongest, then divide by twos)
from natural metrical weighting, pick a few beats to weight higher and a few beats to weight lower
then pick actual rhythms from those second order weights
guitar rhythms should be 1, 2 or 3 notes per phrase (bar)

# violin
also pick some note starting points based on second order meter weights
then pick durations off those anchors (full duration, not quite full, staccato)
maybe put some notes in between anchors to lead from one to another
pick an ornament for each note
make a giant list of many ornament types
after the notation is generated, add in some glisses manually
include slurs automatically
pitches of anchors could be chord tones
notes in between anchors could be chord tones, scale tones, chromatic tones, quarter tones, cents deviation from chromatic tones, or random choices from minor seconds or major seconds
maybe use a particular microtonal scale for a song or phrase or harmony (with cents deviation)


# forms
select a smallish number of forms of phrase sequences
one letter is a bar of 2/4 (a)
one letter plus a dash is a bar of 4/4 (a-)
one letter plus three dashes is a bar of 8/4 (a---)

violin:
- exactly the same
- same rhythm, different pitches in violin due to different harmonies
- same rhythm, different notes: violin changes transposition and pitches adjusted to match harmony
- same pitches and durations, but rhythm "turned around" (broken into chunks, chunks re-ordered), guitar has to change some notes in harmony to accomodate?
- same, but different ornaments or passing tones
- same target note, but different lead-up
- completely different

guitar:
- exactly the same
- same harmonies and durations, but turned around
- put one harmony where there used to be two, put two harmonies where there used to be one
- same rhythm, different harmonies to accomodate changes in melody
- completely different
