Violin and guitar

# harmonies

most important note (1 - 2 notes)

chord (2 - 4 notes)

scale/tetrachord (4 - 8 notes)

almost chromatic (7 - 12 notes)

microtonal
- quarter tone accidentals
- cents deviation
- random within m2 or M2


## harmonic transitions
- totally random
- common tones
- within same scale
- prefer fifths-relationships
- contrapuntal lines where no dissonances are allowed


# Ornaments
- a bunch of fast notes
- combinations of glisses (can't be notated with current system) and slurs



# Rhythm
- rather than choosing sequences of durations, try weighting different metrical positions then choosing whether the note should sustain to the next note or not (full duration, small gap before next note, or staccato)



# Contour
